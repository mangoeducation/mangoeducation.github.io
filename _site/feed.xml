        <title>The winning option</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us see if this works. Is all what I am trying to find out
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social entrepreneurship is a trending venture for some time now amidst aspiring, ambitious and altruistic minds for those seeking a career as an entrepreneur who wants to create positive differences. And it is not a surprise but definitely a pathway to shape a better tomorrow for you and for the nation at large. In this sense what can be a more appropriate option for a social entrepreneur than an educational organisation? In the dynamic today, where information is wealth, knowledge is the weapon that will put the wealth of information to profitable use. This indicates that knowledge is in itself a lucrative commodity. The chances of institutions and organisations that can grow by providing educational services are enormous. The reasons for such conclusions are many, drawn from the current Indian scenario and world’s expectations.
The foremost reason why an entrepreneurial venture in the education landscape can be a winning option is, due to the favourable Indian Demographics. Yes, the world is watching India get younger. The average age is 29 and is expected to further drop by 2050. Conclusively, 500 million Indians will be within the age bracket of 5 to 25 by 2020. This makes it more than obvious the need for educational institutions to be set up to meet the humongous demand, surely our government alone cannot cater to this requirement hence private intervention will see a boost.
Another important phenomenon that backs up the idea is the growing middle class in the Indian economy. The Indian growth rate is enviable and is predicted to grow in the recent future. With a giant young population covering the Indian subcontinent, families and communities are more ready than ever to invest in education of the future generation, be it a vocational training, up skilling or a degree. Education in the Indian scenario is unlike what it was some decades ago; it is now set to serve the Indian working class more than the elitist populace. This translates to a simple fact to the entrepreneur’s delight that the demand is just overwhelming!
Be it anything, the profound factor that is absolutely influential is government, its policies and its interventions. For the benefit of the nation at large, the government gives a positive nod to private educational ventures. In fact the Indian government has been a pro. Its various supportive initiatives make this evident. The government has made education a liberalised sector, it provides policy support for easy credit needed for investment including further operations and tax concessions as incentives to invest and serve. The Skill India campaign by our latest government will be the banner under which a lot more of such initiatives can be expected. It is remarkable to note that the 12th five year plan has strong base in upgrading educational policies and dynamically remodelling the Indian educational scene where private ventures are expected to be strong players.
So when all the three powerful factors- Economics, Demographics and Politics are more than favourable what could go wrong? But experienced academicians and entrepreneurs spot certain challenges.
The risk chart may vary based on the chosen track in education services which are plenty. The greatest challenge however will be to make excellence the benchmark of your organisation and deliver quality with quantity and administer all these with continuing sustainability. The list of threats that will need serious thinking and thoughtful decision will include lack of adequate research, the distance between research and practices, the vast differences in the target population in terms of social, economic and previous educational back up, lack of expertise, inadequate and mostly insufficient expert guidance and ambiguities in the policies.
Some reminders that can serve as pointers to organise a thriving institution in the educational industry will be to ensure quality in the following list:
Administration
Facilitator/Teacher Effectiveness
Target Students
Research and Development
A Strong Alumni Base

If the best can be catered to these dimensions of your educational aka knowledge enterprise, it is a promise that you have got yourself a golden egg laying hen, but make sure you are not the greedy farmer, play it like the tortoise and you will be the winner no matter what the obstacle is! All the Best wishes for the entrepreneur in YOU! Bon Voyage!!!

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
