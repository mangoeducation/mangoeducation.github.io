# [](#python)Python for Beginners

Welcome to Mango Education's young developer project site. This is your companion site for the codes and exercises you practice in your young developer course. Each exercise is important and it is recommended that you follow them all in the intended order. To make it fun and engaging, you will be coding something interesting at the end of every exercise, leading all the way up to developing your own game as a final objective.

We assume that you are already instructed on how to install Python 3 and Sublime Text 3. In case, you hadn't followed it, start reading this from exercise 0. If you have Python 3 and Sublime Text 3 installed, you can start from exercise 1.
